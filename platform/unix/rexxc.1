.TH REXXC 1 "December 2018" "Version 5.0.0"
.SH NAME
\fBrexxc\fP \- Open Object Rexx Compiler
.SH SYNTAX
.B rexxc
.RI inputfile
.RI [outputfile]
.RI [-s]
.SH DESCRIPTION
You can use this utility to produce versions of your programs that do not include the original program source.
You can use these programs to replace any Rexx program file that includes the source,
with the following restrictions:

.TP
1.
The SOURCELINE built-in function returns 0 for the number of lines in the program and raises an error
for all attempts to retrieve a line.
.TP
2.
A sourceless program may not be traced. The TRACE instruction runs without error, but no tracing of
instruction lines, expression results, or intermediate expression values occurs.

.PP
If you specify the
.B outputfile
, the language processor processes the
.B inputfile
and writes the executable
version of the program to the
.B outputfile.
If the
.B outputfile
already exists, it is replaced.

If the language processor detects a syntax error while processing the program, it reports
the error and stops processing without creating a new
.B outputfile.
If you omit the
.B outputfile,
the language processor performs a syntax check on the program without writing the executable version to a file.

.B Note:
You can use the in-storage capabilities of the RexxStart programming interface to process the file
image of the
.B outputfile.
.PP
For further information, read the README and the other
documentation files included in the Open Object Rexx distribution.
