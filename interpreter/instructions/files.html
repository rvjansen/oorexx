   <h1>Open Object Rexx - Files</h1>

   <h1>Interpreter Instruction Source Files</h1>

   <p>This directory contains files that implement each of the ooRexx keyword
      instructions.  Generally, there will be a single set of source for each
      implemented instruction.  For example, to find the code that implements
      SAY, look in the SayInstruction.cpp and SayInstruction.hpp source files.
      Also contained in here are classes for implementing some of the directives
      instructions and a few support classes for some of the instructions.  Note
      that for the most part, these classes handle on execution-time details of
      the instructions.  Source code translation is managed in the parser
      component.
      </p>

   <p>The following is a partial list of the files to be found in this
       subdirectory.  Not all of the files are listed here as intent is
       generally apparent from the name (e.g., SayInstruction is the SAY
       instruction).</p>

   <dl>
      <dt><b>RexxInstruction.*</b></dt>
      <dd>The implementations the base class for all ooRexx instructions.  Each
         of the indidual instruction classes are subclass of RexxInstruction.
         </dd>
      <dt><b>RexxDirective.hpp</b></dt>
      <dd>Defines a base class for directive instructions.  All directive
         implementations will subclass RexxDirective.
         </dd>
      <dt><b>DoBlock.*</b></dt>
      <dd>Runtime information about an active DO block.</dd>
      <dt><b>EndIf.*</b></dt>
      <dd>A synthetic instruction representing the end of an IF construct.
          This is used to manage jumping to the end of conditions.</dd>
      <dt><b>ParseTrigger.*</b></dt>
      <dd>A parse instruction expresses the parse template as a list of trigger
          elements that are processed at runtime.  There will be a single
          ParseTrigger value for each parsing trigger in the template.</dd>
      <dt><b>ParseTarget.*</b></dt>
      <dd>Manages the runtime state of an active parse instruction.  This
          manages the data to be parsed and all of the internal pointers used
          during parsing..</dd>
