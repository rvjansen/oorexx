   <h1>Open Object Rexx - Files</h1>

   <h1>Interpreter Concurrency Source Files</h1>

   <p>This directory contains files used to implement the underlying ooRexx
      thread management.  Many of the classes here a just supporting role
      players used for initiating calls into the interpreter or callouts from
      the interpreter.
      </p>

   <p>The following is a partial list of the files to be found in this subdirectory.</p>

   <dl>
      <dt><b>ActivityManager.*</b></dt>
      <dd>The master subsystem form managing threading issues.  ooRexx uses a
         cooperative threading model, with only a single thread capable of
         running interpreter code at one time.  The ActivityManager handles the
         thread synchronization, scheduling, and dispatching needed to implement
         the multi-threaded behavior.
         </dd>
      <dt><b>RexxActivity.*</b></dt>
      <dd>A RexxActivity instance represents a thread of execution inside of an
         interpreter instance.  Each active thread that the interpreter knows
         about will have a RexxActivity object allocated for it.  The
         RexxActivity manages the execution stack and also performs some memory
         management functions on behalf of the memory subsystem.
