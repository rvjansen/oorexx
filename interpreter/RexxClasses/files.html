   <h1>Interpreter RexxClasses Source Files</h1>

   <p>This directory contains the ooRexx code for core classes in rexx.img that
      are written partially or fully in ooRexx itself.
      </p>

   <p>The following is a partial list of the files to be found in this subdirectory.</p>

   <dl>
      <dt><b>CoreClasses.orx</b></dt>
      <dd>This contains the main addtions to the core classes.  This file
         contains fully constructed classes as well as additional methods that
         are added to the C++ methods of the base classes.  The code contained
         in here is saved in the rexx.img file.
         </dd>
      <dt><b>StreamClasses.orx*</b></dt>
      <dd>The stream class definitions, plus the RexxQueue class.
         </dd>
      <dt><b>SystemMethods.orx*</b></dt>
      <dd>This class is called during image build time to decide what platform
         specific additional classes need to be included in the image.  This
         just delegates processing to the appropriate platform specific file
         based on the system name.
